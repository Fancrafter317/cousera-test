				<h2>Fear</h2>
				<p>
					Fear is a powerful emotion that can also play an important role in survival. When you face some sort of danger and experience fear, you go through what is known as the fight or flight response. Your muscles become tense, your heart rate and respiration increase, and your mind becomes more alert, priming your body to either run from the danger or stand and fight.5 This response helps ensure that you are prepared to effectively deal with threats in your environment
